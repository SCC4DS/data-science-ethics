# Data Science Ethics Modules

This repository contains educational modules focused on ethics in data science, designed to help students develop critical thinking skills around the responsible use of data and statistical methods.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

These modules are built using [https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/), an open-source scientific and technical publishing system. You will need to install Quarto to render and customize the documents.

## Overview

This collection includes several comprehensive modules that can be integrated into statistics and data science courses as desired:

### Introduction
**Focus:** Foundational concepts in data science ethics

This module introduces students to the fundamental principles of ethical data science practice. It covers key concepts such as data privacy, consent, algorithmic bias, and the social responsibility of data scientists. Students explore real-world case studies and develop frameworks for ethical decision-making in data analysis.

**Suitable for:** Introductory statistics courses, research methods classes, or as a standalone ethics component in any quantitative course.

### Visualization
**Focus:** Responsible data visualization and communication

This module addresses the ethical dimensions of data visualization, emphasizing honest and inclusive visual communication. Topics include misleading visualizations, accessibility in design, cultural considerations in data representation, and the power dynamics inherent in how we choose to display information. 

**Suitable for:** Any course involving data visualization, exploratory data analysis classes, or communication-focused statistics courses.

### Classification  
**Focus:** Ethical considerations in predictive modeling and classification algorithms

This module focuses on the ethical issues that can arise when using classification algorithms, particularly in binary classification problems where mistakes are not all equal. It discusses metrics for evaluating a classifier's accuracy and explores the tradeoff between false positive and false negative rates. The module uses real-world examples such as breast cancer screening and criminal risk assessment to illustrate these concepts.

**Suitable for:** Intermediate statistics courses covering regression and classification, machine learning courses.

### Sampling and Data Representativeness
**Focus:**  Ethical issues related to sampling techniques and data representativeness

This module explores ethical issues stemming from sampling techniques and the lack of representative samples. It uses real-world examples likeand Swain's Jury Panel Case Study to promote discussion around the importance of sampling and the consequences of using non-representative data. The module also delineates ethical principles from the American Statistical Association.

**Suitable for:** Introductory to intermediate statistics courses, or courses on data collection and research methods.


### Artificial Intelligence
**Focus:** Ethical considerations for Large Language Models (LLMs) and the use of AI

This module examines the ethical use of Large Language Models and AI in fields like academics, healthcare, and business. It covers how the training data and design of these models reflect the values and ideology of their creators. The content also introduces the concept of "Constitutional AI" as a method for guiding AI behavior with a set of principles.
