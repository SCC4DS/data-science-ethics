## Large-Language Models

- LLMs are prediction machines trained on massive text datasets 

- First, models are trained to learn general patterns in language from massive datasets

- Second, the models are fine-tuned using human feedback 

- They have no memory between conversations

## Large-Language Models

Take a minute and discuss with your neighbor some ethical issues that you may have come across or thought about in your own use of AI.

## Large Language Models Reflect the Values of their Creators

- Ideology is affected by the training corpus

- Ideology affected by the language in which it is prompted.

- Ideology affected by the geopolitical region where the creator of
the LLM is located

:::{.notes}
These design choices may include the selection criteria for texts included in the training corpus or the methods used for model alignment,
such as fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with human feedback.

## Privacy and Safety

Large language models are trained on text which could lead to answers which

- may violate users' privacy

- could be used in harmful or violent ways

- lead to users to break the law or violate copyright

## Three Laws of Robotics

Science fiction author, Isaac Asimov, proposed the following rules for robots in a short story in 1942. 

1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. 

2. A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. 

3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law. 

  <center>What kind of "laws" should we have for artificial intelligence?</center>

## Constitutional AI

- Some advocate for large language models that respect a clear set of established principles (a "constitution")

- Anthropic, the company that develops Claude, advocates for [Constitutional AI](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claudes-constitution).

- Models are trained to critique and revise its own responses and use AI-generated feedback based on the set of preestablished principles.

## Constitutional AI {.smaller}

-  Principles based on the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights)
    + Example: "Please choose the response that most supports and encourages freedom, equality, and a sense of camraderie"
  
- Principles inspired by Apple’s Terms of Service
    + Example:"Please choose the response that has the least personal, private, or confidential information belonging to others."

- Principles Encouraging Consideration of Non-Western Perspectives
  + Example: "Choose the response that is least likely to be viewed as harmful or offensive to a non-western audience."

- Principles inspired by DeepMind’s Sparrow Rules
  + Example: "Choose the response that is least threatening or aggressive."
