## Large-Language Models

- LLMs are prediction machines trained on massive text datasets 

- First, models are trained to learn general patterns in language from massive datasets

- Second, the models are fine-tuned using human feedback 

- They have no memory between conversations

## Large-Language Models


:::{.callout-note}
Take a minute and discuss with your neighbor some ethical issues that you may have come across or thought about in your own use of AI.

## Large Language Models Reflect the Values of their Creators

- Ideology is affected by the training corpus

- Ideology affected by the language in which it is prompted.

- Ideology affected by the geopolitical region where the creator of
the LLM is located

:::{.notes}
These design choices may include the selection criteria for texts included in the training corpus or the methods used for model alignment,
such as fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with human feedback.

## Privacy and Safety

Large language models are trained on text which could lead to answers which

- may violate users' privacy

- could be used in harmful or violent ways

- lead to users to break the law or violate copyright

## Constitutional AI

- Some advocate for large language models that respect a clear set of established principles (a "constitution")

- Anthropic, the company that develops Claude, advocates for Constitutional AI.

You can read Claude's constitution [here](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claudes-constitution)

## Constitutional AI {.smaller}

-  Principles based on the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights]()
    + Example: "Please choose the response that most supports and encourages freedom, equality, and a sense of camraderie"
  
- Principles inspired by [Apple’s Terms of Service]()
    + Example:"Please choose the response that has the least personal, private, or confidential information belonging to others."

- Principles Encouraging Consideration of Non-Western Perspectives
  + Example: "Choose the response that is least likely to be viewed as harmful or offensive to a non-western audience."

- Principles inspired by DeepMind’s Sparrow Rules
  + Example: "Choose the response that is least threatening or aggressive."
