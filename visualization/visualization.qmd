# Storytelling with Data

## Storytelling with data 

After data analysis, how should we communicate our findings?

- Effective communication often involves telling a story

- The story should reflect what you believe to be true based on a rigorous analysis of the data
  - The story should reflect not just your conclusions but all assumptions and your process

- Prepare visualizations that support your story and make a clear point

## What is a story?
<br>
<br>

> A story is a collection of observations, facts, or events presented in a specific order such that they create an **emotional reaction**.
> - [Clause Wilke](https://clauswilke.com/lectures/slides/effective-visualization-2025-04-02.html#/what-is-a-story)

## {.instructor-discussion}

- The previous quote is somewhat provocative in the context of storytelling with data.
  + Why should we seek to create an **emotional reaction**? Shouldn't the goal be honest and clear reporting of evidence?
  + A story can create an **emotional reaction** but be misleading!
  + Discuss the phrase ["Lies, damn lies and statistics!"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lies,_damned_lies,_and_statistics)

- We like to say "let the data speak for itself".  Is that really possible? What would that require?

## A Story About Climate Change


-   The data are from NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) analysis of global surface temperature change. [@hansen2010]

-   The world's temperature is initially recorded in degrees Celsius.

-   The GISS analysis combines available sea surface temperature records with meteorological station measurements of temperature.

-   Then compared to the years 1951â€“1980 as the base period to determine change.

-   Additional adjustments to the average global surface temperature change are made such as accounting for heterogeneity to minimize local non-climatic effects.

-   The Washington Post addressed the tweet by identifying that the National Reviewer had scaled the plot to "hide the actual change in temperature."

-   The National Review failed to address how they treated the data to get the Fahrenheit values.

## Interactive Visualizations

```{r}
#| fig-align: center

library(readr)
library(plotly)
library(tidyr)
library(tidyverse)


#this is me calling in the data 
nasa_data <- read_csv("data/NASAdata.csv")
nasa_data <- nasa_data |> replace_na(replace = 
                         list(Aug=c("****"),
                              Sep=c("****"),
                              Oct=c("****"),
                              Nov=c("****"),

nasa_data <- nasa_data |> 
  pivot_longer(-Year, names_to = "Month", values_to="Temperature_Anomaly") |>
  mutate(Date = ym(paste0(Year, "-", Month)))
## Global yearly Average Temp in F
nasa_data <- nasa_data |> mutate(Temperature_Average = (Temperature_Anomaly + 14)*1.8 + 32) 

fig <- plot_ly(nasa_data, x = ~Date)
fig <- fig %>% add_lines(y = ~Temperature_Average)

fig <- fig %>% layout(
    title = "Average Global Surface Temperature (F)",
    yaxis = list(
      title = "Average Temperature",
      rangeslider = list(type = "Temperature",
                         title = "Global Temperature"
                         ),
      range = list(0, 100)))

fig

```
<center>Manipulate the plot by zooming in and out and evaluate temperature at time intervals.</center>

## {.instructor-note}

- We start with default ylimits to match the tweet, but show how the story changes 
if we zoom in
- Use the "autoscale" button at the top to zoom in or zoom in manually.  Double clicking on the plot resets to the default.

- Why is it maybe not a good idea to start the y-axis at 0 in this example?

## {.instructor-discussion}
Interpretation:

- Is a 1 degree change a lot? Based on day to day experience it seems like not, but there is more to the story.

- Additional plots or results could drive home the story about impact of a 1 degree change.  Hypothetical plots: how much does a 1 degree increase in global temperature impact the prevalence of wildfires? How much does a 1 degree increase impact the abundance of important species in the ecosystem?

- Domain expertise needed to contextualize findings!

- GISS show "temperature anomalies" by subtracting the mean temperature over some baseline period (1951-1980).  Why might this be more desirable?

## {.instructor-discussion} 

What are some pros and cons of interactive visualizations?

- Pro: gives users the ability to explore the data and discover new patterns

- Con: lose control of the narrative, easier for others to distort findings

  + Figures should be designed to tell a story and have a clear purpose.  Simply sharing an interactive visualization might make communication harder.

- Should a static visualization start the y-axis at 0 in this plot? Why or why not?



## Poorly constructed vs unethical visualizations


- There is a difference between an ugly visualization and a bad visualization
  + Ugly visualizations are aesthetically unappealing but can still effectively convey information
  + Bad visualizations are misleading or confusing because of they way they are constructed

## Poorly constructed vs unethical visualizations

-   There is also a fine line between poorly constructed visualizations and unethical presentations.

-   Data scientists should remain honest, provide clarity and avoid violations of openness or objectivity.

-   Ensure that your audience has enough information to make an informed decision that is not unduly influenced by the presenter's values and biases. [@schroeder2022]

# Features of Poorly Constructed Plots

## The use of 3D Graphs {.scrollable}

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](figures/3d%20graph.png)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
3d figures:

-   are often difficult to read.
-   appear to pop out of the page.
-   axes marks appear to be overlapping, which makes some marks more difficult to view than others.
-   lose and distort information when changing between 3d and 2d.
:::
:::::

## Excluding Information

- Excluding information that may impact a reader's understanding includes:
  -   x- and y-axis labels,
  -   variable scale of measurement (e.g. kg., log-transformation, etc.),
  -   clear title or figure labels.
    
- **Deliberately** excluding data or information that might influence the conclusions would be unethical

## Including too Much Information

<center>![](figures/toomuchinformation2.png)</center>

## Including too Much Information

-   Including **too much** information can have the same effect as leaving out information.
    -   Leaving the audience with more questions and confusion.
    -   General rule:
        -   Provide enough information so that your audience can make an informed decision.
    -   Exclude unnecessary text (subtitles, long title, jargon).
    -   Address disproportionate number of numerical values than actual (i.e.,too many values on the y-axis).



::: notes
In the primary graph 19 MLS soccer teams and values spent on players salaries. The graph is broken down by several groups: players, players position. The full length of the bars suggest the total amount spent on players salaries. Individual bar can also be used to compare the relative amount invested on each player within a team. In the sub graph, the data is broken down by players position and dollar amount spent.
:::

## Distorted axis limits

-   Some functions by default fit axis ranges to natural data scales.
-   Non-zero y-axes may cause small differences to appear much larger than truth.
-   When dealing with normalized data ensure that the variables are placed on the same **scale**.

## Distorted axis limits

## Improved axis limits

<center>![](figures/Improvedgraph.png){width="50%"}</center>

::: notes
Highlight how this 3d graph starts at 65% rather than 0. Note that a more appropriate graph would contain data points (65% and 74% accuracy) with an y-axis that began at 0, which is seen in the second plot. By shrinking the y-axis we create the effect that one method seems to have twice as much accuracy than the other.

## Visual Communication

<br>
<br>

> Excellence in statistical graphics consists of complex ideas communicated with clarity, precision, and efficiency." - [@tufte2001]

## {.instructor-note}


Edward Tufte is a Yale professor who is well known for his studies on the characteristics of data visualizations and how such characteristics impact readers. His foundational book ''The Visual Display of Quantitative Information'' (1983) reviews several principles to creating informative data graphics.

How does Tufte's quote on communicating with clarity, precision and efficiency relate to some of the previous discussions around storytelling with data and creating an emotional reaction?

## Tufte's graphic principles to creating useful figures:

-   The physical representation of numbers on a surface should be proportional to numerical quantities represented.
-   Use clear and comprehensive labels.
-   Write out explanations of the data (e.g., in the text, notes immediately following the graph).
-   Show data variation not design variation.
-   The number of dimensions presented should not exceed the number of dimensions in the data.
-   Graphics should not quote data out of context.


# Accessibility

## Accessibility & Color
  -   Human perceptions of color vary. Upwards of 5-8% of men are colorblind! (less common for women)
  -   Colorblindness and complete blindness present accessibility concerns related to visual presenation of information. [@johnson2024]
  -   [@petroff2024] used a machine learning technique to identify color sequences which considered color blindness types, color lightness, color sequence preferences, and aesthetic preferences.
  -   3 sequences of colors were identified and all began with the color blue.

## Accessibility & Visualizations

<center>![](figures/Colorsequence.png){height=5in}</center>

## Accessibility & Color

  -   Surrounding colors influence the perception of others
      -   Choose colors that are not difficult to distinguish among.
  -   Color *association*: 
  
       - avoid color schemes that engage in stereotypes (e.g., black associated with unsafe and white associated with approachable).
  
      -   Keep color schemes neutral
      -   Consider how different mediums (e.g., computer screen, printouts, software) used to display the graphic may influence color.

## {.instructor-note}

Accessibility is the practice of ensuring that all individuals have equal access to resources, programs, and opportunities, regardless of their abilities or backgrounds.

In more recent years, the study of colors in statistical visualizations has burgeoned since visualizations rely on color for many different reasons (e.g. distinction of classes, degrees,effects). Findings from those studies highlight several key themes that researchers need to consider while creating visualizations. 

## {.instructor-note}
For instance, an individual's degree of color blindness may influence the perception of graph or figure. One in every 12 men (8%) and one in every 200 women (0.5%) in the U.S. are born with inherited color defective vision of some type and degree (Johnson, 2024). The most common color-blindness types are red-green and blue-purple. Any color that contains the affected primary color is *distorted*.

## {.instructor-note}

Using neural networks, Petroff (2024), was able to identify sequence of colors that may improve the accessibility of plots. Several variables were used as predictors/features: color blindness types, color lightness, preferred color sequence, and aesthetic preferences. Three color sequences were identified. All started with the color blue.

Different mediums play a considerable role in the perception of graphs, figures, and tables. Colors may be more saturated on a computer than a piece of paper. Different software may use different varying default colors in visual aides. A data scientist needs to consider their audience.

## {.instructor-note}

Deuteranomaly, protanomaly, and tritanomaly are three types of color blindness. Deuteranomaly and protanomaly are red-green color blindness conditions that cause difficulty distinguishing between reds and greens, with deuteranomaly making green appear redder and protanomaly making red appear dimmer and more green. Tritanomaly is a less common blue-yellow color blindness.

## Accessibility {.smaller}

- Researchers have used machine learning to automate data extraction from graphs and figures and consequentially provide the natural language descriptions to support visually disabled users. [@shahira2021]

-   R-packages that assist visually impaired researchers with developing figures and graphs. [@godfrey2018]

-   BrailleR package---an R add-on specifically targeted at blind users---to extract detailed information, such as data ranges, grammatical constructs, etc. to generate speech strings that are embedded into the image annotation. [@godfrey]

-   gridSVG - which exports graphics using the grid package to SVG, which can be read by a screen reader for the visually impaired. [@murrell]

# Outliers and anomalies

## Diamonds Data
Length (x) and width (y) of diamonds listed by online jewelers.

```{r}
data("diamonds")
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = x, y = y)) + 
  geom_point()+
  geom_text(data = subset(diamonds, x < 3), aes(label = x), nudge_y = 2)+
  geom_text(data = subset(diamonds, y > 30), aes(label = y), nudge_y = 2) + 
  theme_bw()
```
## Outliers

-   Take 5 minutes to discuss:
    -   Discuss what you observe in the graph.
    -   How do those extreme values impact the relation between length and width of diamonds after being removed?
    -   Would you drop the outliers and all their additional observed scores?

<iframe width="320" height="100" src="https://vclock.com/embed/timer/#countdown=00:05:00&amp;enabled=0&amp;seconds=300&amp;theme=0&amp;ampm=1&amp;sound=xylophone" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>

</iframe>

## {.instructor-note}

The diamond data set contains prices and other attributes of over 50,000 diamonds.  Most diamonds are "square-ish" so x (length) and y (width) tend to be very similar.

Mistakes could have been introduced by coding for missing values (e.g. 0 or 999) and simple data entry errors

## Outliers and anomalies
Zooming in and excluding outliers from the plot reveals the fundamental relationship more clearly.
```{r}
#| echo: false

diamonds %>% 
 filter(y <= 30, x >= 3) %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) + 
  geom_point() + theme_bw()
```

## Outliers and Anomalies

-   During data cleaning and data exploration, evaluate the data for "unusual values" using visual aides or summary statistics.

-   Units with extreme high, low, or otherwise unusual values are classified as outliers.




## Outliers

- Best to pre-specify your criteria for excluding outliers prior to analysis

- Show results with and without outliers removed. Clearly state:
  + How many observations were excluded
  + The method used for detection
  + How results differ between analyses

## Anomalies

```{r}
diamonds %>% 
 filter(y <= 9, y >= 7, x > 7, x < 9) %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) + 
  geom_point() + theme_bw()
```

Zooming in further on $7 < x < 9$ and $7 < y < 9$ reveals a band where there are no observations.

## Anomalies

Looking at a different feature, the price of the diamond, shows a lack of diamonds priced at $1500.

```{r}
diamonds %>% 
 filter(price < 2000, price >= 1000) %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = price)) + 
  geom_histogram() + theme_bw()
```

## Anomalies

Buried in a reddit thread:

<center>![](figures/diamonds2.png){width="70%"}</center>

## {.instructor-discussion}

- What role does the *data collector* have ensuring the quality, representativeness, and completeness of the data?

- What role does the *data analyst* have in identifying any anomalies or data collection errors?

- May consider returning to a discussion on stories/explanations and [Occam's Razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor).  It's easy to come up with compelling stories about the data, but often it's something as simple as a mistake in data collection.


# Ethical Principles from the OECD

## {.instructor-note}

The following four out of eight [privacy principles established by the Organization for Economics Co-operation and Development (OECD)](http://oecdprivacy.org/) especially relate data visualizations. The principle is first described followed by suggestion to comply with the principles while creating visualizations. Feel free to ask student if they can think of any other practices that will help them comply with these principles.

## Data Quality

-   Principle: Be sure that the data are accurate, complete and kept up-to-date.

-   Poor data will create poor graphics [@tufte2001], which may confuse readers and lead to a wrong conclusion.

-   Evaluate the data for errors, missing values, and extreme values prior to graphing.

## Use Limitation

-   Principle: Personal data should not be disclosed, made available or otherwise used for purposes other than those specified in accordance.

-   Ensure that graphics do not contain personal participant information or that given information can not be directly related to participants.

## Openness Principle

-   Principle: There should be a general policy of openness about developments, practices and policies with respect to personal data.

-   Remain transparent about the data used in figures.

-   Be transparent about how your background may have influenced the graphic.

-   Describe the procedures used to create graphics, including the transformation of data and the removing of outliers.

-   Do not manipulate graphics that change the patterns of the data.

## Accountability principles

-   Principle: A data controller should be accountable for complying with measures which give effect to the principles stated above.

-   If the data in a figure are wrong ensure that your superior knows and the graphic is corrected.

-   Do not let others influence the procedures used to present data or findings.

-   Ensure that you use the proper graphic to display your data.



# Comparability

## How is this figure misleading?

<center>![](figures/RecreationPPF.png)</center>

## {.instructor-note}
Context about the preceding chart: the infographic was presented in 2015 by Republican Jason Chaffetz, the Chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. This chart was presented to Cecile Richards the head of Planned Parenthood during her testimony at public hearing. The chart suggested that Planned Parenthood performs more abortions than cancer screenings and prevention services. [Source: Committee of Oversight and Accountability Democrats](https://oversightdemocrats.house.gov/news/press-releases/politifact-awards-chaffetz-a-rating-of-pants-on-fire-for-using-misleading-chart)


## {.instructor-note}

Key points to note: 

- The total number of cancer screenings and abortions vary dramatically

- Usually best to start the y-axis at 0

- The arrows don't correspond to the real data (graphic is an infographic, not a visualization of real data).

- Can ask students to recreate the visualization, with the data presented as separate lines on the same plot or as two side by side plots and discuss how presenting the data in different formats can be used to tell different stories. Examples follow.


## Side by side plot

```{r, echo=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))
library(patchwork)

## The following data are collected from Planned Parenthood Federation of America Annual Report from 2006-2013

year <- c(2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012,2013)
cancerscreen <- c(2007371, 1900850, 1860413, 1830811, 1596741, 1307570, 1121580, 935573)
abortions <- c(289750, 305310, 324008, 331796, 329445, 333946, 327166, 327653)
pp_data = tibble(year=year, cancerscreen=cancerscreen, abortions=abortions)
```

```{r,}
cancer_plot <- pp_data |> ggplot() + geom_line(aes(x=year, y=cancerscreen)) + theme_bw(base_size=16) 
abortion_plot <- pp_data |> ggplot() + geom_line(aes(x=year, y=abortions)) + theme_bw(base_size=16)

## Plot them side by side
cancer_plot + abortion_plot 
```


## On the same plot

```{r}
pp_data |> pivot_longer(-year, names_to = "Type", values_to="Count") |>
  ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(x=year, y=Count, col=Type)) + 
  ylab("") +
  theme_bw(base_size=16)
```

## {.instructor-discussion} 

What's the best way to compare data across multiple groups?

- Same plot? Different plot?

- Absolute vs relative? Depends on the goal.
  - Cancer screenings did indeed drop by almost a factor of 2 over the 7 year span, likely due to changes in access to healthcare.
  - Cancer screenings still represent far more of the services provided 
  
- What is the best way to accurately and ethically convey the meaning of this data?

## Case study: cancer deaths

- Since 1980, have cancer deaths in the United States been increasing, decreasing or remaining roughly constant? 

- Before you look at data, hypothesize about possible trends and suggest reasons for those trends.

## Case study: cancer deaths

```{r}
cancer_data <- read_csv("data/IHME_cancer.csv")

cancer_data |> filter(cause_name == "Total cancers",
                      age_name == "All ages",
                      metric_name == "Rate",
                      location_name == "United States of America") |> 
  ggplot() + geom_line(aes(x=year, y=val)) + theme_bw() + 
  ylab("Cancer Deaths (per 100000 people)") + 
  ggtitle("United States")

```


## What story does the data tell?

```{r}
cancer_data <- read_csv("data/IHME_cancer.csv")

cancer_data |> filter(cause_name == "Total cancers",
                      age_name == "All ages",
                      metric_name == "Rate",
                      location_name %in% c("Japan", "Uganda")) |> 
  ggplot() + geom_line(aes(x=year, y=val, col=location_name)) + theme_bw(base_size=16) + 
  ylab("Cancer Deaths (per 100000 people)")

```

This visualization is valid, but perhaps misleading. Why?



## Median age over time

```{r}
age_data <- read_csv('data/median-age.csv')

age_data |> 
  mutate(Country = Entity, `Median age` = `Median age - Sex: all - Age: all - Variant: estimates`) |> 
  filter(Year < 2025 & Year > 1980) |> 
  filter(Entity %in% c("Japan", "Uganda")) |> 
  ggplot() + geom_line(aes(x=Year, y=`Median age`, col=Country)) + theme_bw(base_size=16) + 
  ylab("Median Age")


```

:::attribute
Source: [ourworldindata.org](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/median-age)
:::

## {.instructor-note}

- Japan is a country that is rapidly aging

- Uganda is a relatively young country with a lower life expectancy

- Age is one of the most important predictors of cancer prevalence.  Fewer people live to old age to get cancer in Uganda.

## Age-Standardized Cancer Deaths

```{r}
cancer_data <- read_csv("data/IHME_cancer.csv")

cancer_data |> filter(cause_name == "Total cancers",
                      age_name == "Age-standardized",
                      metric_name == "Rate") |> 
  ggplot() + geom_line(aes(x=year, y=val, col=location_name)) + theme_bw(base_size=16) + 
  ylab("Cancer Deaths (age-standardized)")

```
See [https://ourworldindata.org/age-standardization](https://ourworldindata.org/age-standardization) for more discussion.

## Comparability

- Always consider relevant reference or comparison groups

- Ask: is **standardization** needed for fair comparison? Are there lurking variables?

- Highlights that expertise is often needed to generate the most appropriate visualization 

- Visualizations can be misleading without the relevant context

## {.instructor-discussion} 

Some useful discussion questions about responsibility and power dynamics:

- How do power dynamics change what stories get told with data and how that data is presented?

- Is the creator of a visualization responsible for how that visualization is interpreted and used?

- What makes somebody qualified to visualize data?
